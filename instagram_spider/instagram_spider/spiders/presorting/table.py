class Table():
    '''
    Data structure description:
        - Very similar to an adjacency list
        - Has 'buckets' that are distributed in a Log Normal Distribution see
          [1] for more info, the reason for this distribution is outlined in
          experiments/number_statistics.ipynb
        - For example if the number of followers is 200 it'll be seperated into
          the bucket for values betweeen 195-205 (or something similar), while
          at the same time if the value was 200k it'll be in the bucket of
          150k-250k followers
    [1] http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogNormalDistribution.html

    TODO in the future:
        - Use a hash table which will find the bucket based on the Log Normal
          Distribution (useful if the dataset is big enough â€“ for now this is
          good enough)

    Possible additions:
        1. Increase the number of buckets when it gets too full to improve
           speed, would split the current buckets into these ranges.
           Eg: prev bucket range was 100-200, new buckets at 100-150 and 151-200
           traverse list and set element 150 to 'None' and set 151 to be the
           first element of the next bucket

        TODO:
            - Make this work in any general case for both lists, arrays, etc.
            - The problem here is how to iterate over the buckets:
            - eg (made up ranges): go through the elements in bucket 1
              (1-10 followers), then bucket 2 (11-20 followers), all the way to
              the last bucket (1m-10m followers)

              from a bucket into a string and then writing once per bucket
